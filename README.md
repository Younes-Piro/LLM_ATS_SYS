# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Project

## Problem Statement

Recruitment teams face significant challenges in efficiently screening, ranking, and managing large volumes of job applications. 
Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems often rely on rigid keyword matching and rule-based filters, which can:

* Miss qualified candidates due to non-standard CV formats or varied terminology.
* Fail to capture nuanced skills, experiences, and context from resumes.
* Require manual intervention for shortlisting, slowing down hiring processes.
* Provide limited insights into candidate fit beyond basic criteria.

With the rise of diverse candidate backgrounds and unstructured application data (CVs, cover letters, portfolios), 
there is a need for a more intelligent, context-aware system that can understand natural language, extract relevant information, and make fair, explainable recommendations.

##  Goal:

Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an ATS that:

* Parses and understands resumes and job descriptions in natural language.
* Identifies skills, experiences, and cultural fit beyond keyword matching.
* Ranks candidates based on semantic relevance and role requirements.
* Generates summaries and recommendations for recruiters.
* Supports multilingual processing

## Impact

*For recruiters:* the system reduces manual screening time and improves quality of shortlists.<br>
*For candidates:* it ensures fairer evaluation by recognizing skills and experiences expressed in diverse formats and languages.<br>
*For HR managers:* it provides actionable insights into talent pipelines and hiring trends.

## Architecture & Frameworks :

To address these challenges and achieve the outlined goals,
I propose a modular architecture that ensures scalability, flexibility, and compliance, while leveraging advanced natural language processing
to deliver accurate, fair, and explainable candidate recommendations.

The following frameworks have been used to achieve this goal:
